# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
title: From Angular to Blazor - Building a Front-end Without Javascript
email: ew@atuw.org
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  A blog that documents my transition from building web front-ends in Angular to Microsoft's
  new Blazor framework. As Blazor is still very early in its life-cycle, there's still not
  much documentation on it. Hopefully my stuggle can help other developers with the transition.
baseurl: "/blazor-blog" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://atuw.net" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
